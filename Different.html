    <p>
        Maybe it had to happen<br>
        because God knew I wouldn't move unless I was forced to. Maybe He saw the parts of me that were too comfortable, too afraid, too unwilling to let go. Maybe He knew that without the breaking, I'd never see the beauty of surrender.<br><br>
        The pain felt cruel, the loss felt unfair, but maybe<br>
        —just maybe—it was mercy in disguise.<br><br>
        Maybe it had to happen, not because God wanted me to suffer, but because He wanted me to grow into who He always knew I could be.
